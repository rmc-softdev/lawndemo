# Demo Project

This repository represents a refactoring of the legacy project page available at https://aniworld.netlify.app/advanced-search/. The refactor includes various enhancements, particularly in terms of architecture.

Due to time constraints, the primary focus was on improving functionality while maintaining minimalistic designs. Although several unnecessary complexity layers, such as caching with Tanstack and Redux, were introduced, they were primarily included to showcase these technologies.

Adding more would be just a matter of repetition, the core structure is therefore here.

# Steps to run
